### Introduction
This is a project I started working on at Hackers@Berkeley's Fall 2013 Hackjam. It lets you see not only the menus from the Cal Dining website, but also some of the ingredients in each dish. If you're like me and you don't eat beef or pork, this is a useful way to quickly identify the dishes that you shouldn't eat. If there are other ingredients you'd like to watch out for, you can specify them in ingredients.py.

### Dependencies
* Python 2
* Flask 0.10.1

### Running
Run in port 5000 as follows:
```python
python caldining.py
```
